# Introduction #

This page will show the benchmark of OpenCV algorithm vs DSP OpenCV algorithm.


# Details #

For the benchmark click on the link below.This page shows the approx. value. More precise values will be updated soon. This benchmark shows no permormance imporvement. Eexecution time is calculated from the start to end of an application. Since I have been exploring different possibilities, benchmark will be upgraded if there is noticable improvement in the performance.

Since, the first release of this work, it has gone under many changes. This work now uses C6accel library. All the new work is added to C6accel library. Calls to DSP are made asynchronous. For new benchmark result please click on the link below. Execution time of individual algorithm is provided in the benchmark.
